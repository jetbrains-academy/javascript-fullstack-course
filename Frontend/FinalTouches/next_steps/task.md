That's it!

You now have enough knowledge to start your journey in full-stack JS development.
Although the tasks in this section are complete, you can always find something to improve in your project.

Here are a few ideas to get you started:
- Add a link to the register page from the login page, and vice versa like this: 
  ```jsx
    <p className="form-footer">
      Don't have an account? <Link to="/register">Register here</Link>
    </p>
  ```
- Use different background colors for user messages and others' messages.
- Automatically scroll to the bottom when new messages arrive.
- Add a feature to edit messages.
- Create public and private chat rooms.
- Add a light/dark mode toggle.
- And much more!
