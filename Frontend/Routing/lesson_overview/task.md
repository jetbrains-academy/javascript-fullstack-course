In this lesson, you will learn how to:
- Create an application with multiple pages and routing between them.
- Implement this routing based on the internal state.

### What's the routing for?
In our application, we need at least three different views: a login page, register page, and of course, a chat page.
A logged-in user should go straight to the chat view instead of the login page. 
Similarly, if someone who isnâ€™t logged in tries to access the chat, they should be redirected to the login page.

_Routing_ lets you handle it based on user interaction and authentication state.
It can also allow you to create [Single Page Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) (SPAs) 
where users access different sections without reloading the entire page.

### CSS
In the code examples, we will use different CSS styles to make our application look nice.
For it, we will update the `frontend/src/index.css` file from task to task,
so if you want to know more about how this or that visual was achieved,
look into this file.
