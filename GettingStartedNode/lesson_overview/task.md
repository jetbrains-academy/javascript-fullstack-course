### About Node.js
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code.
Although JavaScript has typically been used for the front-end, 
Node.js makes it possible to write both client-side and server-side code using the same language.

It is quite fast, beginner-friendly and gives you access to an extensive package ecosystem ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)) 
that provides countless reusable components for various tasks, saving time and effort in development.

Node.js uses an event-driven asynchronous architecture, where the system reacts to events (like requests or actions) 
as they happen instead of waiting for tasks to finish. This prevents delays and makes it a good choice for real-time applications.
