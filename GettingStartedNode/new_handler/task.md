It's time for some practice! Let's do a quick warm-up and make sure we are on the same page.

Currently, the backend is respond with `Hello, World!` when a request is made to the `/` route, and `Page Not Found` for all other routes.

### Task
Add one more route, `/sum`, which for now should only return the text `'TODO in the next lesson'` with a status code of `501`. This status code means [Not Implemented](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/501) and is perfectly suitable for this case.

Later on, we will actually implement this route in a slightly different way, but for now, let's start like this.

<div style="text-align: center; max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto;">
<img src="images/scheme.png">
</div>

Pressing the `Check` button in below this text, you can verify your solution with our automatic testing system, 
but you can always check how your program works as it was shown in [Hello world](course://GettingStartedNode/hello_world) task.
