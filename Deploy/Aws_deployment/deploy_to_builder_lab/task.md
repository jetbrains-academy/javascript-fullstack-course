By completing this task, you will be able to:
- **Deploy containerized applications to AWS ECS**: Gain hands-on experience deploying full-stack JavaScript applications to a production-ready container orchestration platform.
- **Configure AWS infrastructure**: Set up and work with AWS services, including ECS, ECR, ALB, and EC2 instances, in a hands-on lab environment.
- **Implement container registry workflows**: Push Docker images to Amazon ECR and configure ECS to pull images from the registry.
- **Understand microservices deployment patterns**: Deploy the complete inventory management system with gateway and API services as separate containers.

## Implementation requirements
### Amazon Elastic Container Service
You can deploy your complete full-stack application (backend + frontend) to AWS 
the [same way](https://github.com/jetbrains-academy/skillpath-aws-freetier-labs-instruction/blob/main/Working%20with%20Amazon%20Elastic%20Container%20Service.md) 
you already did for the multicomponent Flask application.

### Amazon CodeDeploy
We also recommend you look at the AWS CodeDeploy service and try to deploy your application with it.
It is not covered by the AWS Free Tier, but it is totally affordable.

Follow the instructions in the guides: [Deploying Software to Amazon EC2 with AWS CodeDeploy](https://github.com/jetbrains-academy/skillpath-aws-freetier-labs-instruction/blob/main/Deploying%20Software%20to%20Amazon%20EC2%20with%20AWS%20CodeDeploy.md).
